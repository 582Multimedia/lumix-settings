# Lumix cameras settings

Settings for lumix s5ii and s5iix cameras

All of the movie mode uses v-log color profile, to get accurate colours, you will need to download one or more of these LUTs (Look-up Table):

- [VLog_to_V709_forV35_EN](https://av.jpn.support.panasonic.com/support/global/cs/dsc/download/lut/index.html)
- (applies to both s5ii and s5iix cameras) ***you will need this***

If you want to unlock the maximum quality, you can use an external recorder to record [Apple ProRes RAW](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/102124), in which case, you will need this:

- [V-Log/V-Gamut conversion of RAW output data](https://av.jpn.support.panasonic.com/support/global/cs/dsc/download/lut/s1h_raw_lut/index.html)
- (only possible with s5iix) ***not likely for students, but Bruce and I probably need it***
